Welcome to the Bing project guide.The target audience of this guide are developers of bingcore itself. 
If you are a user of Bing (either a contract developer, or validator running a node), please refer to the user docs.
Practices describe, broadly, how we write code. For example, if you want to learn about code style, issue tracking, or debugging performance problems, this is the chapter for you.
The roadmap will be developed after the main code.
Approximate development timeline is the second quarter of 2024.
